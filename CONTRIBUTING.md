# Contributing to Galactic
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").
7. We have adopted squash-and-merge as the policy for incorporating PRs into the master branch.  We encourage more smaller/focused PRs rather than big PRs with many independent changes.  This also enables faster development by merging PRs into master quickly and reducing the need to rebase due to changes on master.
